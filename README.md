### About the Book
Deep Learning is no longer shrouded in mystery. In fact, it is the emerging new frontier – the bleeding edge – of AI.  It is increasingly achieving superhuman feats and evolving beyond human comprehension. From image and voice recognition, to AI personal assistants and self-driving cars, achievements and breakthroughs that were once mere science fiction are now becoming our reality. Top tech companies world over are all in the game – trying to win the race for AI, with Deep Learning.

The question now is, do you want to simply be a bystander in this new-age game?

The art of building deep learning systems is becoming easier every day.

This book can be your guide to discovering it yourself.

Build Deeper is a complete and practical guide that can help you take the first few steps in deep learning. It will guide you step-by-step, from understanding the basic concepts, to building your first practical application.

It covers:
  - What Deep Learning is, and where it fits with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
  - How Deep Learning came to be, its predecessors, and the path it took to evolve into what it is today.
  - The important milestones it has passed through the years, and the impact they had on the field.
  - What tools are available for us to learn and build deep learning applications, and how to set them up: Python, TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, and more, on any OS of your choosing: Windows, Linux, or Mac OS.
  - Building our first simple deep learning model.
  - The internal workings of a deep learning model.
  - Using more advanced topics such as Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning, Bottleneck Features, and Fine Tuning to build a practical deep learning application.
  - Getting started with Computer Vision.

All you need now is a little enthusiasm … who knows where it will take you!
